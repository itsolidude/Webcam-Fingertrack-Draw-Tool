# Hand Skeleton Drawing Project with MediaPipe and OpenCV

## Project Overview

This repository showcases a Python project where I leveraged Google's MediaPipe and OpenCV libraries to recognize the skeleton of a hand and implement a unique drawing feature. The core functionality centers around identifying the index finger's landmark and using it as a pointer for drawing on the screen.

## Key Features

- **Hand Skeleton Recognition:** Utilizes MediaPipe's hand tracking capabilities to identify and map the skeleton of a hand in real-time.
- **Index Finger Drawing:** Extracts the landmark of the index finger and transforms it into a drawing tool, enabling users to draw on their screen by moving their finger.
- **Real-Time Interaction:** Offers a seamless and interactive drawing experience, with movements of the hand directly translating to drawing actions.

### Toggling Drawing Mode
To toggle the drawing mode on and off:

1. **Make a Fist with Your Left Hand:** Clench your left hand into a fist to activate or deactivate the drawing mode. When drawing mode is active, you can draw on the screen using your right index finger.

### Drawing
Once the drawing mode is activated:

2. **Use Your Right Index Finger:** Point and move your right index finger to draw on the screen. The movements of your finger will be captured and transformed into drawing strokes.

### Erasing
To erase parts of your drawing:

3. **Bring Three Fingers Together on Your Right Hand:** Touch your thumb, index, and middle fingers together to switch to erasing mode. Move these fingers over the areas you want to erase.

## Technologies Used

- **Google MediaPipe:** An advanced machine learning library for hand tracking and gesture recognition.
- **OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library):** A library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision.
- **Python:** The project is developed using Python, known for its simplicity and powerful libraries in the realm of computer vision and machine learning.

## Project Goals and Learning Outcomes

- **Innovative Use of Technology:** The project demonstrates an innovative application of machine learning and computer vision technologies in a creative context.
- **Skill Development:** Enhanced my skills in Python programming, real-time image processing, and application of advanced machine learning models.
- **Practical Application:** Explores the practical use of hand tracking technology beyond traditional use cases, like gesture controls or sign language interpretation.

## Future Enhancements

I plan to refine the drawing tool's accuracy and explore additional features such as varying brush sizes, color options, and gesture-based controls for a more dynamic and enriched user experience.

## Collaboration and Contact

I welcome feedback, suggestions, and collaboration opportunities from fellow developers and enthusiasts in the field of computer vision and machine learning. Feel free to reach out for discussions or potential collaborations.
